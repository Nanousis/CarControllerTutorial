A car controller now with UI Buttons. You can use the MyButton on any ui item and acess it. 
After that you can just call your MyButtonVariable.isPressed to get a boolean representation of the state of the button.
As a plus you can also reach the MyButtonVariable.dampenPress to get a 0-1 float represenation of the state of the button.
